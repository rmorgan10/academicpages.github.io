## Current Research
Since October 2017, I have been working to try to identify the sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. Neutrinos are very hard to detect particles, but when they pass through the Antarctic ice they emit radiation, allowing researchers to indirectly find the path the neutrino traveled through the ice. By tracing the path of interactions in the ice, IceCube can tell approximately where in the sky the neutrino came from, and this is where my focus lies.

Something in space, most likely far outside our galaxy, must have emitted the neutrino that IceCube detected, and many researchers share the common goal of finding the neutrinos' origins. One hypothesized class of neutrino sources is a collapsing star. The violent nature of supernovae and composition of the star leading up to the explosion cause the emission of both neutrinos and light. The goal of my research, then, is to use telescopes to observe the part of the sky from which IceCube traced the neutrino's origin, and to try to find an exploding star by looking for the light that was emitted at the same time and from the same place as the neutrino.

My collaborators and I, as part of the Dark Energy Survey, use the Blanco 4-m Telescope located at the Cerro-Tololo International Observatory in Chile. After receiving a neutrino alert and sky location from IceCube, we take pictures of the part of the sky of interest using the 570 Megapixel Dark Energy Camera over approximately a three week period. We then subtract the images pixel-by-pixel from previous images of that same part of the sky to see if anything is significantly brighter than expected--like a recently exploded star would be.
