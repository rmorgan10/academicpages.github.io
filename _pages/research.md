## Current Research
<img align="right" src="/IceCube_caption.png" width="400">
Since October 2017, I have been working to try to identify the sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. So far, there have been over 50 of these neutrinos, but only one has had its source discovered. Neutrinos are very hard to detect particles, but when they pass through the Antarctic ice they emit radiation, allowing researchers to indirectly find the path the neutrino traveled through the ice. By tracing the path of interactions in the ice, IceCube can tell approximately where in the sky the neutrino came from, and this is where my focus lies.

Something in space, most likely far outside our galaxy, must have emitted the neutrino that IceCube detected, and many researchers share the common goal of finding the neutrinos' origins. One hypothesized class of neutrino sources is a collapsing star. The violent nature of supernovae and composition of the star leading up to the explosion cause the emission of both neutrinos and light. The goal of my research, then, is to use telescopes to observe the part of the sky from which IceCube traced the neutrino's origin, and to try to find an exploding star by looking for the light that was emitted at the same time and from the same place as the neutrino.

My collaborators and I, as part of the Dark Energy Survey, use the Blanco 4-m Telescope located at the Cerro-Tololo International Observatory in Chile. After receiving a neutrino alert and sky location from IceCube, we take pictures of the part of the sky of interest using the 570 Megapixel Dark Energy Camera (DECam) over approximately a three week period. We then subtract the images pixel-by-pixel from previous images of that same part of the sky to see if anything is significantly brighter than expected--like a recently exploded star would be.

A major challenge for this project is that a lot of things (typically several hundred) can change in the region of the sky we point the telescope at: there can be asteroids passing through our line-of-sight, galaxies can flare as their central black holes devour nearby stars and dust, and there can even be many supernovae that we detect that are unassociated with the neutrino. I have played a significant role in developing an automated procedure for sifting through the hundreds of transient objects to pick out the supernovae that are the correct chemical composition and exploded at the correct time to have plausibly been the source of the neutrino IceCube detected. To construct our selection procedure, I have used supernovae simulations, machine learning algorithms, and several data analysis and statistical tools; if you're interested in a more-detailed descritption of the analysis methods, please email me!

### Looking Forward

By 2022, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have replaced Blanco/DECam as the most powerful optical telescope on the planet. LSST will be able to find objects much further away and much fainter than Blanco/DECam can, and will also be able to observe the entire southern sky. With the technological imrpovements of LSST, we anticipate having a much greater chance of detecting a supernova if it happened to be the source of an IceCube neutrino.
<br><br>
Slightly after first light at LSST, the IceCube Collaboration has planned to start an expansion of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube Gen2). The original cubic-kilometer detector would reach a new volume of ten cubic-kilometers, which is roughly the 4,000 times larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza. The bigger detector would make tracing the path of the neutrion much more precise, making it much easier to isolate the source of the neutrino in the sky.
<br><br>
Along with continuing the search for neutrino sources, I will also be playing a role in the science verification of LSST while it is being constructed. Essentially, before we can take accurate observations of distant objects, we need to make sure we fully understand and can appropriately handle the data coming from the telescope. Over the next few months, I will be helping to calibrate the light filters of the camera so that studies like the neutrino source detection project can be possible.
