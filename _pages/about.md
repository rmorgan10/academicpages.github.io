Hello!

I am a graduate student in the Physics Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying astrophysics and computer science. I am passionate about understanding as much as possible about dark matter, dark energy, and the structure of the universe. I am also interested in employing state-of-the-art statistical tools, machine learning algorithms, and visualization techniques to parse and analyze the large datasets relavent to these physical problems.

On this website you can find information on my current research, side projects, outreach involvement, and other interests. Thanks for visiting!
