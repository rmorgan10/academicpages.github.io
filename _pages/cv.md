Materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rmorgan10/UWMadisonPGSC-PD) and events are document on the UW-Madison PGSC Professional Development [Website](https://rmorgan10.github.io/UWMadisonPGSC-PD/).

### Teaching

_Role:_ Graduate Teaching Assistant, UW-Madison

Instructed an introductory electricity and magnetism course for undergraduate engineering students during the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters. I designed worksheets, quizzes, and lesson plans for roughly 100 students.

_Role:_ Undergraduate Mathematics Computer Lab Tutor, Wayne State University

Guided students through algebra problems from 2013 to 2017. Named the Mathematics Computer Lab Tutor of the Year in 2014.

### Outreach

_Role:_ Wonders of Physics Volunteer, UW-Madison

Performed and explained physics demonstrations for children ages 0-15 at the Wisconsin Science Festival (2018), STEMfest at Northern Illinois University (2017), and Girl Scout Science Day at UW-Madison (2017).

_Role:_ Camp Cosmos Counselor, Wayne State University

Responsible for guiding ~20 middle school students in science activities and field trips during a week-long summer camp (2017).

### Leadership: WSU Club Soccer

_Role:_ President, Coach, Treasurer, and Player for the Wayne State Club Soccer Program from 2014-2017

Organized a soccer program at the club-collegiate level. Ran tryouts, coordinated community volunteering efforts, reserved fields, managed budgets, fundraised, purchased new balls and jerseys, coordinated travel, planned practices, and managed and played in games. Brought a full-size soccer field to the WSU campus for the first time in school history. In all three years, the program was a top team in the league and stayed in the black financially.
